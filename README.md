# Customer-Churn-Predictive-Analysis

By Chandan Kumar Sangewar, Thrisha B & Anjana Chowdary


Businesses must estimate churn to retain consumers and be profitable. Machine learning can forecast client attrition across sectors. This research compares telecoms industry churn prediction machine learning methods. This study's dataset includes customer data and churn status. Preprocessing includes managing missing values, encoding category variables, and scaling numerical characteristics. Next, we use logistic regression, neural network, random forests, xgboost, and support vector machines.These algorithms are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve area. We study how feature selection and hyperparameter adjustment affect machine learning algorithms. Our findings indicate that feature selection and hyperparameter modification may greatly increase certain algorithms' performance.
Our study shows that machine learning can predict churn, compares algorithms, and calculates the expected lifetime value and cost of retaining old customers using survival analysis. This study may help telecom companies retain customers and increase profits.
